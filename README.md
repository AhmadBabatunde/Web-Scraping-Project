# Web-Scraping-Project
#Python Scrapy spider that scrapes product data from Walmart.com.

I scraped and extract the following fields from Walmart product pages:

Product Type
Product Name
Brand
Average Rating
Manufacturer Name
Description
Image Url
Price
Currency
Etc.

I used scrapeops that helps against the anti-bots on the walmart websites and used scrapy to extract the data.
